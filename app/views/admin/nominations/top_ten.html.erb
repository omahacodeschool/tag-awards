    Make sure you do not save any changes from this page until you are 100% complete with nomination approvals, including all spelling/formatting changes. It's important to have fully consistent data before setting the final ballot, as otherwise the final ballot can end up being inaccurate.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are certain that all of the nominations for a particular award are correct and have all been approved, then it is okay to set the final ballot for just that award.

    Note: Once the final ballot for an award has been set, it cannot easily be changed. So be sure you're ready to proceed before submitting anything below.

    To set the final ballot for an award, check the box next to a nomination and also verify the theater/award by selecting the correct theater/award from the dropdown. This strange extra step is, at least for this year, necessary. Do this for each line you want on the final ballot for an award, and then click the button to submit. <strong>You cannot set the final ballot for more than one award at a time.</strong>
